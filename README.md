# CMSC-128.2
Project for CMSC 128.2 - Software Engineering II

This website is developed by a group of students from University of the Philippines of Manila as part of their requirement for CMSC 128.2 - Software Engineering II.  This project will develop an information system UI based on a case study about major depressive disorder prediction using machine learning techniques. The objective of the project is to utilize the case study as basis to the system and create a user interface that will be easy to understand for the target users that will mainly utilize this system, namely patients, researchers, and clinicians. 

The two research articles entitled Major Depressive Disorder Prediction Using Data Science and Explainable AI for Autism Classification in Children were done by Ma'am Ma. Sheila A. Magboo & Sir Vincent Peter C. Magboo. These articles can be accessed through these links https://pjhrd.upm.edu.ph/index.php/main/article/view/647, https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-3359-2_17 respectively. 

This website is made possible with the guidance of our teacher, Ma'am Ma. Sheila A. Magboo.
