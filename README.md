# CMSC-128.2
Project for CMSC 128.2 - Software Engineering II

##Overview
This project is a website development undertaking by a group of University of the Philippines of Manila students as part of their CMSC 128.2 - Software Engineering II course requirement. The goal of the project is to create an information system UI that is centered around the case study of major depressive disorder prediction using machine learning techniques. The main objective of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface that will cater to the needs of the primary users of the system, including patients, clinicians, and researchers.

The development team will be utilizing the research articles "Major Depressive Disorder Prediction Using Data Science" and "Important Features Associated with Depression Prediction and Explainable AI" authored by Ma. Sheila A. Magboo and Dr. Vincent Peter C. Magboo as a basis for the project. These articles can be accessed via the following links: https://pjhrd.upm.edu.ph/index.php/main/article/view/647 and https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-3359-2_17, respectively.

This website is made possible with the guidance of our teacher, Ma'am Ma. Sheila A. Magboo.
